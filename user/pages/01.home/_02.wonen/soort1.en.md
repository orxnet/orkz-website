Living in the ORKZ
------------------

#### Involvement / participation
Every resident is expected to be actively involved. Together, the residents agreed that everybody should work one half-day a week for the building/community. This contribution is important for maintaining our way of living, while also keeping the costs affordable. It should be noted that the ORKZ is not intended as cheap housing for students. 

#### Woningcoöperatie De Koevoet (The Board)
As residents of the ORKZ, we are officially organised as ‘Coöperatie de Koevoet’ (Cooperation the Crowbar). This cooperation pays rent to the (much larger) housing association Nijestee, and the residents pay their rent to the cooperation. When you sign a lease contract, you automatically become a member of the cooperation. 

#### Resident's Meeting 
The residents’ meeting, or the ‘Bewonersvergadering,’ is the most important part of living in the ORKZ. Residents vote on proposals made by the board or brought up by residents. Decisions made in the residents’ meeting are carried out by the board or one of the committees. Once a year the residents’ meeting chooses a new board, who are responsible for daily management and internal and external relations.

#### ‘Technical Service’ and ‘Maintenance’
The physical maintenance of the building is carried out by two separate committees: the ‘Technische Dienst’  and ‘Onderhoud’ (‘Technical Service’ and ‘Maintenance’ or TD and OH). The Technische Dienst does this for the most part below ground: they maintain and adjust the central heating and the service pipes. Maintenance does their work mainly above ground: they are responsible for big and small renovation projects and maintenance of the communal spaces. Bigger jobs are outsourced. Residents usually do minor maintenance of their own rooms themselves.

#### Koevoeter Courant
The Koevoeter Courant (Crowbar Courier) is the main channel of communication of the cooperation. It contains messages from the board and committees, the agenda and notes from the residents’ meeting, opinions, announcements of fun activities like parties, band- or theatre performances, and any other things related to the ORKZ. Occasionally, when there are bigger issues to discuss, we publish an ‘Orkz Magazine.’
