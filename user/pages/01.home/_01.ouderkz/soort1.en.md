The ORKZ
------------
The ORKZ was once the largest squat in the Netherlands, and it has kept that atmosphere of community, creativity and shared responsibility. Nowadays the building is rented from a housing association in a unique arrangement where the residents are still collectively responsible for the maintenance of the building. As well as a diverse range of housing spaces, the ORKZ rents out artists’ studios, workshops and  practice rooms. There is also a cinema, a café, a bar and a theatre.
