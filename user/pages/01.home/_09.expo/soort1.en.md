Expo
----

Every two months ORKZ-ART organisez an exhibition in the Dagcafé. Talented residents from the ORKZ and other artists show their drawings, photography, paintings to the public. Exhibitions are festively opened with acoustic music, DJs and performances and the artist tells something about his or her work. If you have a nice idea or project, or if you have something to exhibit, you may contact us. Exhibitions will be announced on this website. Visitors can just drop by. And because it is located in the Dagcafé, you can drink a cup of coffee or tea if you like.
