Expo
----

Every three months there is an exhibition in the Dagcafé. Residents can display their drawings, photography, paintings etc. to the public. Exhibitions usually have a festive opening where the artist tells something about his or her work. If you have a nice idea or project, or if you have something to exhibit, you may contact us. Exhibitions will be announced on this website. Visitors can just drop by. And because it is located in the Dagcafé, you can drink a cup of coffee or tea if you like.
