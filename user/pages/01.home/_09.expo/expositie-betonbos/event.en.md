ORKZ-ART presents: The Betonbos Experience EXPO:  

A tiny forest in the center of the city, with concrete roots.
Betonbos has been a place to live, work and live together in a community of 20 people for 15 years now.
It is an organically grown green freespace with a fairytale look, creativity and art.
28 June we present a tiny bit Betonbos in the ORKZ to celebrate the existence of alternative living in Groningen.

With artists from in and outside the Betonbos an music from Journeymen Soundsystem we present you a special night.
This night will be a big installation with the atmosphere of our loving Betonbos.

The Opening: 20.30, Dagcafe ORKZ. With music, performances and ART!
