Dagcafé (Day Café)
-------

The ‘Dagcafé’ (Day Café) is viewed as a public ‘living room’ for residents of the ORKZ. You can have a cup of coffee, tea or a drink most days until about 23:00. There is a pool table, a free give-away shop with secondhand goods, and a little shop with organic food products which is open on days that the restaurant serves dinner. The restaurant, the entrance and ticket sales of the RKZbios and Theater de Kapel are all located in the Dagcafé. 

**Opening hours:** Always if Bios/Eethuisje is open (ma/di/do/vr/za/zo), otherwise when/if someone is available to run it (Zelfwerkzaamheid).
