The ORKZbar
----------
*Check out [www.orkzbar.nl [fa=external-link /]](http://www.orkzbar.nl?target=_blank)*

The OrkzBAR is located in the former kitchens of the ORKZ, which is still visible from the tiles on the floor. Residents and visitors are welcome at night for a drink. Regularly, there are band performances. We have had some great artists in the Bar: de Kift, the EX, Hugh Cornwell, Mike Watt and Armand, to name a view. Our parties, always organised by Orkz residents, range from techno to metal night and reggae party to jam-sessions. The Bar is not for rent.
