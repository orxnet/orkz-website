**[The Fifth Alliance](https://www.facebook.com/thefifthalliance/)**
<br>A 5-piece from Breda who blend blackish sludge, gut-wrenching doom and hypnotic (post)hardcore/metal. After debuting with their well-received album ‘Unrevealed Secrets Of Ruin’, the band went full steam ahead with the release of its successor: ‘Death Poems’. The Fifth Alliance leaps forward in terms of intelligent arrangements, subtle passages and building layers of atmosphere, led by Silvia Berger’s heartfelt screaming of pure emotion and beauty.

The recent release of their third album 'The Depth Of The Darkness' shows this alliance is capable of a level of intensity most bands can only dream of. If track titles like 'Hellfire Club' and 'Into Extinction' don't already warm your heart, experiencing the aptly named opening track and single 'Black' surely will.

<br>Under the chromium filled smoke which fills the skies in the IJmond region Feast emerged as the flag bearers of dark and heavy music. They have been layering loudness for years, sharing the stage for many years, hating this world for many more years. Aside from the usual escapism Feast puts this anger in making dark doom/sludge.
The band delivers an auditorial onslaught which will kill any inclination to ignore that hungry darkness inside. Let the feast begin!
