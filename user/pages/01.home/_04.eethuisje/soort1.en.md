Het Eethuisje (the restaurant/diner)
---------
On Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays you can join us for a delicious dinner. The not-for-profit restaurant is located in the day-café (dagcafé), which is located next to the main entrance on the Emmastraat. The food is always vegetarian; a meat or vegan option is often available too. Dinner is served at 18:30 (6:30pm). You can sign up after 15:30 at the restaurant or by phone. If you want to know what’s on the menu, follow our Facebook page. A three course meal costs approximately €6.
If you want to volunteer in the restaurant, you can come to our meeting, which is held almost every Monday in the dagcafe. Talk to one of the volunteers if you want more information, or just drop by!
