Enrollment:<br/>The Intro
---------------------------------

If you want to live in the ORKZ, you have to enroll with the ‘Intro’ (the Introduction Committee). Below are answers to questions you might have about the procedure. If you have a specific question, you can call the Intro. The number is 050-5267250. You can reach us on Thursday afternoon between 14:00 and 18:00. There is also a contact form. 

####Enrollment procedure

**Registration**: Every Thursday at 20:00 (8pm) at the office of the ORKZ. Be on time, because we lock the door at 20:00 sharp. During this evening we give the ‘intro talk’, with information about living in the ORKZ and the enrollment procedure.

**Tour**: another part of the process is a tour through the building. During the registration evening you can sign up for a tour. It takes place every other Sunday night at 19:00, and it takes about an hour and a half. The tour guides will show you the whole building, giving you a pretty good understanding of what it means to live in the ORKZ. The tour can be given in English or Dutch, but please let us know ahead of time.

**Handing in your letter**: aspiring residents are also required to hand in an application/motivation letter. It can be written in English or Dutch. You can hand over your letter at the start of the tour, drop it in the mailbox at the door of the office, or hand it in at the office during opening hours (Mondays between 14:00 and 18:00 and Thursdays between 14:00 and 18:00). Don’t forget to put your phone number in the letter.

**Extending your enrollment**: four weeks after your registration you have to extend. There are various ways to do that: call the office, leave a message in the notebook at the office, put a note in the office mailbox or drop by on Thursday afternoons during intro opening hours. After these four weeks, your letter will be put in the ‘active folder.’ Units that are searching for a new neighbour usually pick about three people out of the folder to invite to a getting-to-know-you meeting (‘kennismaking’).

Important: every four weeks you have to extend your enrollment again. If you extend by calling or dropping by, the Intro will inform you about the next extension date.

###FAQ	
* ###How can I extend my enrolment?
  By calling the office, leaving a note, putting a message in the notebook at the office or dropping by during opening hours.
* ###How often do I have to extend my enrolment?
  Every four weeks (note: not monthly), counting from the day of enrolment. We will tell you what your next extension date is when you extend.  
* ###Why such a comprehensive enrolment procedure?
  In the ORKZ, we live together and work together. It’s important to us that new residents make a well-informed, conscious choice to become a part of the ORKZ.    
* ###How long will it take before I get a room?
  After the procedure of the four-week enrolment waiting period, you may be chosen for a room at any moment. However, there are ways to improve your odds; see below for some tips in the section “How do I increase my chance of getting a room?”
* ###How do I increase my chance of getting a room?
  If you want to live in the ORKZ, you might want to drop by every now and then. You could volunteer in ‘het Eethuisje’ (the restaurant) or get to know people at the Bar. It also helps if you write a nice letter, in which you tell us something about who you are, why you would like to live in the ORKZ and how you might contribute to the ORKZ.
* ###What do the rooms look like?
  The rooms come in all kinds of shapes and sizes: they range from about 15m2 to 60m2. Most smaller rooms come with a ‘high sleeper’ (elevated) bed. Most of the time, new residents will get one of the smaller rooms on a unit (in some cases a ‘discount room’). Most rooms don’t have their own kitchen or bathroom, so you have to share those with your hall mates. Units vary in size and number of residents: there are units from two to up two twelve people. Discount rooms are the smallest rooms in a unit. Apartments or studios (rooms with a kitchen and bathroom) are seldom available, and when they are, they get assigned to residents who have been living in the ORKZ for a long time and were actively involved in all those years. Below you can read how much you pay for a room.
* ###Do I have a choice in which room I get? 
  You cannot choose your room beforehand. If there is a room available, a unit might invite you to an introductory getting-to-know-you meeting, and if there is a personality click, you will be offered the room. You always have the right to turn down the room, but it is important that you do that during the meeting. If a unit calls you after the meeting to tell you that they chose you, and you tell them you don’t want the room after all, you are no longer eligible for a room in the ORKZ. 
* ### How much is the rent?
  There are three rent levels in the ORKZ. A normal room costs €343 a month. An apartment or studio is €411,54 a month and the discount room is €324,12 a month. As well as paying rent, you have to contribute to the building by helping out. This is called ‘zelfwerkzaamheid,’ a word which is difficult to translate but can mean ‘self-efficacy,’  ‘own industriousness’ or ‘own labour’ (‘werkzaamheid’ is the Dutch word for both an activity and a virtue). When you sign the contract you agree to contribute at least two hours a week, on average, of your time to the ORKZ.
* ### I need extra help, is this possible in the ORKZ?
 In the ORKZ we live together and help each other out. However, we are not an assisted-living institution with social workers or caretakers; the general idea is that you are able to live independently or arrange your own help.
