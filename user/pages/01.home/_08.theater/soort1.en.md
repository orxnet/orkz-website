ORKZ Theater de Kapel
------------------

*Check out [www.theaterdekapel.nl [fa=external-link /]](http://www.theaterdekapel.nl)*

ORKZ Theater de Kapel is a fully equiped theatre where at the moment mostly musical performances are held. Since a few years the 'Concert in de Kapel' is known for its intimate and exciting concerts in very different genres: from traditional to experimental! We also organize jam sessions, and every last friday of the month the poetry event [PoÃ«zie Met [fa=external-link /]](https://www.facebook.com/PoezieMet/)!' is held!

The Kapel is available for activities of a non-commercial nature, and one condition is that it's freely accesible for residents of the ORKZ. We facilitate for example improv theatre groups and gatherings of different organizations that are preoccupied with the gas related earthquake problems in the province of Groningen.
