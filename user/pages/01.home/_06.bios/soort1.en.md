Cinema (ORKZBios)
-------

*Check out [RKZbios Website [fa=external-link /]](http://rkzbios.nl?target=_blank)*

The ORKZbios – from the Dutch word ‘bioscoop,’ a cinema –  has distinguished itself for over 35 years as the smallest cinema in Groningen. It has a unique atmosphere and an original and distinctive programme of films and related activities. The RKZbios is located on the first floor of what used to be the chapel of the old hospital; a mural of Jesus above the projection room is a reminder of the former use of this unusual space. The cinema plays movies every Saturday and Monday, and sometimes on Sunday. It is also possible to rent the cinema for private shows or lectures.
In 1980, when the old hospital had been claimed by the squatters’ movement for about a year,  films were first shown in the building in another room on 16mm. A few years later, the cinema moved to its current location above the chapel. During the nineties the cinema got a 35mm projector – which is now being displayed in front of the theatre as a relic of lost times – and bit by bit the theatre became more professional. Five years ago we went from 35mm to digital projection and the theatre was refurbished. The RKZbios has been an independent cinema for over 35 years and is ready for the future!
